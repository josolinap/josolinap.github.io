Welcome to my new portfolio site! I'm excited to share my journey as a creative developer and showcase the projects that define my work.

## What You'll Find Here

This site serves as both a portfolio and a blog where I share:

- **Projects**: Detailed case studies of my work
- **Thoughts**: Articles about development, design, and technology
- **Experiments**: Fun side projects and technical explorations

## Getting Started with Decap CMS

This site is now powered by Decap CMS, which means you can easily edit content through a user-friendly interface. Simply visit `/admin` to start creating and editing posts, pages, and projects.

The CMS allows you to:
- Write blog posts with rich markdown formatting
- Upload images and media
- Manage project portfolios
- Create static pages

## Next Steps

Feel free to explore the site and check out the admin interface. I'm looking forward to sharing more content and projects with you!
